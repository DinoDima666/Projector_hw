# Write a program that will simulate user scores in a game. 
# Create a list with 5 playersâ€™ names after that simulate 100 rounds for each player. 
# As a result of the game create a list with the player's name and score (0-1000 range). And save it to a CSV file. 
# The file should look like this:

# Player name, Score
# Josh, 56
# Luke, 784
# Kate, 90
# Mark, 125
# Mary, 877
# Josh, 345
# ...
# Write a script that reads the data 
# from the previous CSV file and creates a new file called high_scores.csv 
# where each row contains the player name and their highest score. 
# The final score should be sorted by descending to the highest score. 
# The output CSV file should look like this:

# Player name, Highest score
# Kate, 907
# Mary, 897
# Luke, 784
# Mark, 725
# Josh, 345
